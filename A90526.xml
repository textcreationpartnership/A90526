            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </head>
            <p>THe wiſeſt of Kings hath told us, <hi>That there is a time, and a ſeaſon for all things; a time to keep ſilence, and a time to ſpeak;</hi> and certainly now, if ever, the laſt time is not only conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient, but abſolutely neceſſary: And ſhould man hold his Peace and neglect this Duty, even the Stone ſhould cry out of the Wall, and the Beam of the Timber ſhall anſwer it: I direct this my Diſcourſe and Perſwaſive to Unity in Religion to all in general; But more particularly to thoſe, who are <hi>Diſſenters</hi> from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and who ſeem to make a breach in the Conformity, and happy Unity of the Church; and over-nice Scruples, cauſe a <hi>Schiſm</hi> and rent in its ſeamleſs Garment. 'Tis to You that I now ſpeak; as a Friend, as a Brother, for ſo we ought to be one to another, and not as Wolves and Dogs, ſnarling and ſnapping one at the other, but with gentleneſs and freedom admoniſh one another; with all lowlineſs and meekneſs, with long-ſuffering, forbearing one another in Love: 'Tis the command of Chriſt, who is Love it ſelf, <hi>That we Love one another;</hi> by It we are known to be his true Diſciples, and followers of him. And there can be no greater ſign of his Love, than friendly to admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh one another of Errors, and ſtraying from the Truth; and to aſſiſt the weak, to raiſe up thoſe that fall; to call to Unity and Concord, and to ſtir up to Peace and Amity: <hi>That we may be all of one mind, having compaſſion one of another, loving as Brethren, being pitiful, being courteous; not rendring evil for evil, and railing for railing,</hi> 1 Pet. 3.8, 9.</p>

            <p>Since Separation and Diviſion among Brethren proceeds from the cunning and malice of Satan, why ſhould it continue any longer in our <hi>Iſrael?</hi> why ſhould not every man put to his helping hand, to build up the walls of Unity? Are we not Brethren? Have we not one Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, God? One Head, Jeſus Chriſt? Is he not our common Shepherd? Have we not one Faith, Salvation by Chriſt? Do we not believe him come in the Fleſh? Do not we confeſs his Name? Are we not all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians? And indeed are we not alſo of one Mother the Church? Why then this Separation? This Diviſion? This drawing ſeveral ways? Why cannot, or why do not you Unite as you ought to do? And that this may be effected, and that our happy Unity may be laſting and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual.</p>
            <p>You muſt leave off to interpret the whole ſcope of Scripture, as if framed to maintain your own form of Government, preſenting your followers with falſe Gloſſes, whereby they read only as you would have them, and pervert Scripture to maintain the falſe <hi>Ideas</hi> of ſickly Imaginations; and thus every Sect makes the Scripture to ſpeak in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of their way and falſe Opinions, to maintain their <hi>Schiſm</hi> and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration; calling all <hi>Samaria</hi> and <hi>Babylon</hi> that are not of themſelves, and their own Congregations, <hi>Sion</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> You muſt alſo leave off thoſe Names of Separation and diſtinguiſhment, calling your ſelves the <hi>Godly,</hi> the <hi>Brethren,</hi> the <hi>Good People, Gods Children,</hi> the <hi>Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied;</hi> Others the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngodly, Reprobates, Wordlings, Time ſervers, Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſers, Moraliſts,</hi> and <hi>Latitudinarians, Arminians,</hi> and the like. You muſt alſo ceaſe to cry out againſt Magiſtrates and Rulers, Kings and Governours, as <hi>Severe, Cruel</hi> and <hi>Tyrannical</hi> upon the leaſt reſtraint of your Liberties; as if you were thereby become Martyrs for the Cauſe of Chriſt: Alſo you muſt not ſpeak contemptibly of Biſhops, (as ſome too frequently do,) giving them ſcurrillous Names, as <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, Spiritual Tyrants, Lordly Biſhops,</hi> &amp;c. And-calling the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Goſpel in contempt <hi>Priests,</hi> nay <hi>Baal</hi>'s <hi>Priests, Time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervers, State Divines, Dumb Dogs, Vain Bablers,</hi> with ſuch like Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage; Thoſe whom the Scriptures Dignifie and Honour with the Titles of <hi>Christs Embaſſadors, Gods Stewards,</hi> and the like.</p>
            <p>Open then your Eyes at laſt, and look not ſo a ſquint on this Form of Government; and more particularly as it is here Eſtabliſh'd in the <hi>Church of England,</hi> which certainly is the moſt like, and comes neareſt to the Primitive Inſtitution of the Apoſtles, and the next Ages of any Church in the World, both for the Purity of its Doctrine, and the Order of its Government; its Ceremonies being both few and Decent, and its Power regulated by Iuſt Laws.</p>
            <pb n="3" facs="tcp:154329:3"/>
            <p>And as one ſays, <hi>The Church of</hi> England <hi>is a Body of ſo firm a Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſo excellently Temper'd, and ſo well Shap'd,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vind. of the Conforming Clergy. <hi>p.</hi> 50.</note> 
               <hi>and of ſo clear a ſtrength and vigour in all its Limbs that no out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward force is able to injure it; nothing but ſome inward Corruption and decay in the Vital parts that can poſſibly bring it to the ground.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed ſome had trip'd up its Heels and lay'd it all along, but it was but a Foil, you ſee how ſoon it aroſe again; and in that little Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpace or <hi>Inter-regnum,</hi> as I may term it, what horrid Confuſions were amongſt us? Methinks this little Tryal might convince you of the weakneſs and Imbecility of the one, and the Firmneſs and excellent Temper of the other Government; by which this Land has ſo long flouriſhed, and which is ſo fitted not only to Monarchy, making that Maxime good, as we by experience ſaw, <hi>No Biſhop, No King;</hi> and among the reſt the Learned Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> in his <hi>Pref. Sect.</hi> 1. has theſe words, which he ſets down as his full perſwaſion, <hi>Surely the preſent Form of Church Government, which the Laws of this Land have Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, is ſuch as no Law of God, nor Reaſon of Man hath hitherto been alledged of force ſufficient to prove they do ill, who to the uttermoſt of their power withſtand the alteration thereof. And contrarywiſe, the other, which inſtead of It, we are requir'd to accept, is only by Error and Miſconceit, named the Ordinance of Jeſus Chriſt, no one proof as yet brought forth whereby it may clearly appear to be in very deed.</hi> And thoſe two Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions he hath ſo fully and unanſwerably maintained in his excellent Book of the <hi>Laws of Eccleſiaſtical Polity,</hi> that methinks you ſhould lay your Finger on your Mouths, and no longer ſpeak againſt this Form of Church Government, nor remain at this diſtance, and in this ſtate of Separation, till you have found out better Arguments for to juſtify your ſo doing, than thoſe you have yet made known to the World.</p>
            <p>Therefore, as the <hi>Form of Divine Service, contain'd in the Book of Common Prayer,</hi> which is now uſed in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth ſo much to the Edifying thoſe that uſe it, and it agrees exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with the Rules of the Apoſtles, and is performed in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> the Vulgar and common Language of the Nation, which every one un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands: But in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> the common People are made uncapable of being Edify'd by the Prayers of the Church, in that they are all made in <hi>Latine,</hi> a Language which they do not all underſtand. So that when they meet to Worſhip God, there are ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom any in the Congregation that knows what is ſaid there, except
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:154329:4"/>the Prieſt that read it: But Bleſſed be God for it, it is not ſo with Us; for Ours is truly <hi>Common Prayer,</hi> for it is written and read in that Language which is common to all the Congregations in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; So that no man that frequents our Publick Congregations, where the <hi>Common Prayer</hi> is uſed, can ever plead Ignorance of any one Duty whatſoever: For if it be not his own fault, he may there be inſtructed in every thing which he that made him, requires of him.</p>
            <p>And ſeeing it hath pleaſed the moſt high God to compriſe his whole Will, (and by conſequence our Duty,) in the <hi>Ten Commandments;</hi> hence we read them conſtantly every <hi>Sunday</hi> and <hi>Holy day</hi> through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole year; by which means every one that doth not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſhut his Eyes may clearly fee, and fully underſtand his whole Duty both to God and Man; eſpecially, conſidering, that in the <hi>Prayers</hi> themſelves alſo there is frequent mention made of all thoſe Vices, which ought to be avoided, and all thoſe good works which ought to be performed by us: So that we can never come to Church, but we are ſtill put in mind, both of what we ought, and what we ought not not to do that we may be ſaved. Whereas if all and every perſon in the Congregation, would always be upon their Knees, while they put up their Petitions to the moſt high God, what a mighty advantage would this be, not only to every one in particular, but to the whole Congregation in general? For as every one would by this means keep his heart more ſtedfaſt in the true fear and dread of God, and likewiſe more certainly obtain the good things he Prays for; and by this means we ſhould excite and enflame each others Devotions, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm and ſtrengthen one anothers Faith, and convince both our ſelves and all that ſee us, that Religion is a ſerious thing; and that we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it to be ſo, by our ſerving God with ſo much Reverence and Godly fear, as this humble Poſture repreſenteth; for it is lamentable to think what abſurd things are done in the time of <hi>Divine Service;</hi> for I have ſeen ſome People ſitting in the time of <hi>Common Prayer,</hi> if we did but conſider we are in that Holy place, where Gods Majeſty is repreſented, and our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who ſhall judge us all at the laſt day; and therefore as you tender the Love of God, the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit of Religion, or the Salvation of your own Souls, I beſeech you all in the Name of him that made you, that whenſoever you come hither to Pray unto Him, you do it in that Awful, Lowly, and Solemn manner, which our Church commandeth, and as becomes Creatures, when you ſpeak to your Great and Almighty Creator; that ſo you
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:154329:4"/>may give true Worſhip and Honour unto Him, and alſo receive that Benefit and Edification of your ſelves, which he hath Promiſed, and you expect from <hi>Publick Prayers:</hi> This being certainly the moſt edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Poſture that you can poſſibly uſe upon ſuch occaſions.</p>
            <p>Therefore great Bleſſings do we loſe by neglecting to come to the Publick Prayers of the Church on the Week days, when we have ſo great opportunity, and our Churches ſo near us, and Prayers Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and Evening in a great many places; and yet how many do neglect coming, and what a poor Congregation do we ſee in many great Pariſhes? Is not this a ſhame to Chriſtian Religion: We find time for every thing elſe, and ſhall we not find time for this great Concern of our Souls; for with what Conſcience can we expect a Bleſſing from our Heavenly Father, without asking it? And what an ungrateful thing it is to receive Bleſſings at Gods hands daily; and not as daily to acknowledge and give him Thanks for it in publick every day, as well as private? For by the publick we let the World ſee we are not aſhamed of our Religion.</p>
            <p>For my Charity prompts me to believe, that all the zeal that ſome expreſs againſt the <hi>Common Prayer,</hi> and all that indifferency that is in others for it, proceeds from their Ignorance of what it is, or at leaſt from their want of an Experimental knowledge of it. For let any man that ſeriouſly minds the Worſhip of God, and the Salvation of his Soul before all things elſe, let ſuch a one, I ſay, ſet himſelf in good earneſt to uſe the <hi>Common Prayer</hi> as he ought to do for ſome conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable time, and I do not doubt (but that by the Bleſſing of God,) he will find that benefit and edification by it, that his own experience ſhall convince him of all that I have now ſaid, more than all the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that I have, or any man in the World can ever produce to him.</p>
            <p>Lay aſide now your Paſſions I beſeech you, put off your former Converſation, and be renewed in the Spirit of your mind: Speak every man Truth with his Neighbour, for we are Members one of another, Chriſt is our Head: There is but one Body, one Spirit, one Lord, one Faith, one Baptiſm, one God and Father of all. O do but conſider the Beauty of Unity, let it allure you, let it break your ſtifneſs, let it move you to run into the open Arms of your Mother, and to be knit in the Bands of Amity with your Brethren. Confider how good and how pleaſant it is for Brethren to dwell together in Unity. And <hi>Pſal.</hi> 133.</p>
            <pb n="6" facs="tcp:154329:5"/>
            <p>How Happy and Bleſſed then would the Nation be! The Nations round about us would Tremble, and our Adverſaries would be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded. O that there were a full Aſſent and Conſent among you both in Spirituals as well as Temporals!

How then can you Anſwer your contempt of the Laws and Commands, not only of a Chriſtian Prince, but of our own Church too: One that Commands nothing but Lawful things; it is not enough that you think otherwiſe of them, and that you pretend Scruples of Conſcience, there is no ſuch exception in the Rule laid down by the the Apoſtle. <hi>Let every Soul be ſubject to the Higher Powers: Submit to every Ordinance of Man,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Rebellion is as the ſin of Witcheraft, and Stubborneſs is as Iniquity and Idolatry.</hi> Let us conſider that <hi>Caeſar</hi> is our King, <hi>Caeſar</hi> is the Lords Anointed; <hi>Caeſar</hi> is our Nurſing Father; <hi>Caeſar</hi> is the Breath of our Noſtrils; <hi>Caeſar</hi> is the Son of ſuch a <hi>Caeſar</hi> who was a Martyr, who laid down his Life to preſerve us from Slavery. Our <hi>Caeſar</hi> hath been Miraculouſly Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd, and Miraculouſly Reſtor'd; nothing can be too Much, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be too Dear for ſuch a <hi>Caeſar.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Certainly Obedience to ſuch a Prince, and to his Lawful Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, would be more acceptable than all your long Prayers and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Preaching which is become your Idol, and which you ſet up in the room of the Croſſes you have pull'd down. Speak out, and tell us whether an Act for <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity</hi> and <hi>Conformity</hi> made by the three States of the Land, be a Legal Act or no; If it be, why do you not Obey? Why do you trouble the Waters with your need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:154329:5"/>Scruples of little weight and value, and about Trifles only, as you call them? Is not the Word truly diſpenſed in our Publick Churches? Are not the <hi>Sacraments</hi> rightly Adminiſtred? Are not our <hi>Prayers</hi> free from Scandal and Irreverence? Are not our Doctrines clear of Errour and Falſity? Why then do you deny to Hear, Receive and Communicate together? But in ſpite (as I may ſay) both of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of God and Man, ſeparate your ſelves, and run into Diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience? I verily believe thoſe of the Church of <hi>England</hi> would never run into that contempt of the King and his Laws; I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded that for Conſcience ſake they would ſubmit, ſhould the King and Parliament by their Authority take away thoſe Ceremonies about which you contend; they have learn'd better than to Rebel, and the Doctrine of our Church hath endued us with ſounder and better Principles.</p>
            <p>O that I could but make you ſenfible of the Bleſſing of this Unity; How much Glory it would add to the Nation! How much Scandal it would take from Religion! How much Security it would give to three Kingdoms! How much Content and Satisfaction to your Prince, and how much Joy and Gladneſs to the Hearts of all your Brethren; what Peace ſhould we enjoy at Home! What Eſteem and Awe ſhould we purchaſe Abroad! What Love would be begotten between one another! And what Happineſs and Proſperity would it bring to all! You would then ſee again thoſe Happy days of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> our Armies to Proſper, our Citizens to Flouriſh, Conqueſt Abroad, and Peace at Home; <hi>Charity</hi> to increaſe, and Contention to ceaſe; Love to abound, and Strife to wax leſs. The <hi>Golden Age</hi> would ſeem to be return'd again, and Righteouſneſs would run down like a ſtream; there would then be a general rejoycing in our Streets, and we ſhould all cry out, <hi>This is the Lords doing; it is marvelous in our Eyes.</hi> At laſt therefore endeavour to ſatisfy your Conſciences, go about it in earneſt, lay aſide all Stubbornneſs of Heart, all Spiritual Pride, all Self-Intereſt. Let the Caſe be ſtated truly betwixt you: There are thoſe that will not think much to convince you, if Scripture and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon will do it. But you muſt then come with willing minds, you muſt not be ſo ſtiff as you have hitherto been, rather than comply o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e jot, you will Break, you cannot Bow; you will not yield in what you may, in thoſe things that you cannot Condemn; you will not ſo much as Read the Chapters appointed for the Day, becauſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded; you will not repeat the <hi>Creed</hi> and the <hi>Ten Commandments;</hi> you will but rarely admit of the <hi>Lords Trayer,</hi> becauſe by us ſo often
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:154329:6"/>uſed,) a Prayer compoſed by Wiſdom it ſelf, and therefore it muſt needs be the moſt perfect and Divine Prayer that was ever made. And thoſe who have thus far comply'd and ſet you a good Example, have been reproach'd for it, and have been look'd upon as Backſliders. But this is not the way to Unity and Peace, you muſt bring willing and yielding Hearts with you: you muſt not be Obſtinate and Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niative; you muſt not be Reſolved before-hand; you muſt have De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires and Longings for Unity; you muſt hear without Paſſion and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, and with a deſire not of Diſputing and ſhewing your Parts, but of ſatisfying your Minds and Conſciences, and then no doubt but your Scruples may be all reſolved, and you may Conform with ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.</p>
            <p>Lay theſe things ſeriouſly to your Heart, paſs them not ſlightly over, think not theſe words only a little vain Air, God may call you by a weak inſtrument, by a ſmall Voice. Reſiſt not the Spirit, Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den not your Hearts. This God that Calls, he would have you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, remember the Womb wherein you were Born, and the Paps that gave you Suck. Think of the Peace and Unity of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> be Dutifull as Children, Love as Brethren, Obey the King, Submit to Ordinances, be Subject to Rulers, Honour the Magiſtrate, Yield to Governours, be United in Mind, be of one Heart, Worſhip toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Separate no longer, and God will build you up: <hi>Then God will be known in</hi> Judah, <hi>and his Name will be great in</hi> Iſrael. You ſhall then be United like <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah,</hi> you ſhall have but one King, you ſhall be no more two Nations. What Nation will there be ſo Great, who hath God ſo nigh unto them: <hi>Then you ſhall be his People and he will be your God; he will give you one Heart, and one Way, that you may Fear him for ever; for the good of you and your Children after you. Then will ye with one Mind and one Voice glorify God, even the Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
